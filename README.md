# Retired

The code here is outdated and I would guess no longer works with modern versions of Next.js. I have left it here for reference, but archived for a reason!

## Setup

Youâ€™ll need an Airtable account with an API key. The sample code is matched to a table structured like so:

## Install

1. Clone this repository and run:

````
npm install
````

2. Then create a `.env` file and add your Airtable API key and Base ID to it like so:

````
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=keyXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXX
````

## Run

1. First start the Redis server with:

````
redis-server
````

2. Then Start Next with:

````
npm run dev
````

Now go to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see your Airtable data. If you run into trouble, have any questions, etc. feel free to file an issue.
